MCMM v1.0 changelog !

bug fixes:
- Fixed bug when loading a pack without any mods (like playing in vanilla) causing crash
- Missing "please wait" at various places (when loading or deleting packs...)
- Fixed settings window not sized correctly (was too short to see anything)
- I don't remember, just optimizations and stuff

main features:
- Save packs without any fear and bug (for now)
 - Give it a name, a version, a mods list (if you want to not get lost in your own library) and a modloader
   (if used, if not default is vanilla)

- Load packs (no backup for now, be careful !)
 - Load a pack from your library, putting your mods, configs and options together inside of .minecraft !

- Auto updater (if activated in settings)
 - Just looks for update at startup (if not disabled in settings)
 - Can update from the settings window, works like the auto updater from startup.

- Import
 - Load a pack from a '.mcmp' (basically a zip file) and give it a name.

- Finally added the Export feature !
 - Export a pack from your library
 - Give it a name (to the archive), a location and pouf ! (also, wait the moment it tells you it's done)

To finish, i added a demo pack to celebrate the release of v1.0 !

I will now concentrate on correcting bugs, and maybe features if there is something interesting
that comes up !
In the next update, i will work on user-friendly usage, as custom .minecraft location
