MCMM v0.9.6 changelog !

bug fixes:
- I don't know, just optimizations...
(no any bug found within my code for now)

features:
- Save packs without any fear and bug (for now)

- Load packs (no backup for now, be careful !)

- Auto updater (if activated in settings)

- Added Import feature !
 - Load a pack from a '.mcmp' (basically a zip file)
 - Currently stable for now (I hope)

- List all packs, their versions, and loaders

The importing feature will be useful when you are going to get the export feature...
Hope you still enjoy it for now !
