Minecraft Mod Manager v0.2.3
This software is free and opensource !

(please give this github link if you want to share it)

 My goal:
install new modpack (precise config needed for now, add to library), acquire alredy installed modpack to library (from .minecraft/mods/Version and associated options), update options/modpack from the .minecraft, load saved modpacks from library, options included

If you discover any glitch, give it into the issues !
I'll respond to you as fastest as possible.

No binary for now, I promise that I will work on it later.
