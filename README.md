MC Mod Manager is a free and open-source project, it permits (and will permit for some features)
profiles gestion (options, mods, configs...) without any install, with it's portable capacity.

Then, i didn't reached v1.0 for now, and it means that every update is important, to get the most stable and useful version, since only a few features are up for now.
To finish the warnings (most of it):
This program is ONLY supported for Python 3.8 and 3.9 ONLY, i didn't test it on others...
it use pillow (for future features), PyQt5, os, random, shutil, sys and time, so you should install these (if not alredy done) before running my software.

It should be easy to use:
- Create a pack (from an alreddy installed one in your .minecraft) by clicking File > Save
  You can name it as you want (as long as it follows naming rules for windows folders)
  In the version textbox, type the Minecraft (and loader for now) version, like Forge 1.19.1
  In the mods textbox, type all the mods you want (i will implement a detection later, it's manual for now) separated by ","
  Leave the last textbox empty, it's not useful for now, future feature !
- Load a pack from it's box (by cliking Load)
  Warning ! for now, i didn't implemented the backup feature, it will discard all your options and configs when you do it, so be careful !
- Delete a pack from it's box (There is a small message box to confirm, it's not an action that you can undo, be careful)

Thanks for reading, see you soon for the next update !

v0.9.1 - Maniko
